# Appendix B - Working areas

## Upstream repository

A repository of your code to share and collaborate with other developers. It is
hosted somewhere on the internet. The best known hosting providers are GitHub,
GitLab, and Bitbucket. The default alias name when you initially clone a
repository is 'origin'. The upstream repository can also be called 'remote
repository', or just 'remote'.

## Local repository

A local directory named `.git` that contains all of your necessary repository
files. This repository has exactly the same features and functionalities as any
other Git repository. Work is done in your local repository (committing,
merging). The changes are then pushed to the remote for others to see and
interact.

## Index

A staging area for file changes to commit. Before you commit files, you need to
first add them to the index. This is also called 'current directory cache',
'staging area', 'cache' or 'staged files'.

## Working directory

The local checkout of your code. Here you make changes to your local codebase.
It is also called 'Working Copy' or just 'checkout'.

## Stash

A place to hide modifications while you work on something else. This is useful,
when you need to change a branch but you have uncommitted changes in your
working directory.
