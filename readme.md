# Git collection

This repository serves two purposes:

First, there is a set of automatic demo scripts which will execute a series of
Git commands to show interesting insights into the internals of Git. You can
find these fast tracks into various hidden and advanced topics in the
[internals](internals) folder.

Second, a list of the most useful day-to-day Git commands with beginners in mind
can be found in the [cheatsheet](cheatsheet) section of this repository. This
also shows you how to work with the commands, gives examples to ignore certain
files from the Git database, and helps understand the different working areas.
There are also some screencasts using the PhpStorm IDE (although, this can be
useful for any other Jetbrains product as well). These show a few simple
workflow demonstrations to connect Git commands with their IDE counterparts.

Feel free to propose any missing features and improvements.
