# Git collection

This repository serves two purposes:

Firstly, provide a list of the most useful day-to-day Git commands with
beginners in mind. This also shows how to work with the commands, gives examples
of how to ignore certain files, and helps understand the different working areas
in Git. There are also some screencasts using the PhpStorm IDE (although, this
will be useful for any other Jetbrains product as well) with a few simple
workflow demonstrations to connect Git commands with their IDE counterparts. See
[cheatsheet](cheatsheet) for more information.

Secondly, there is an automatic demo script which will execute a series of Git
commands to show interesting insights into the Git internals. See
[internals](internals) for more information.
